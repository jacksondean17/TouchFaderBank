# LED Fader Bank
Our project is a fader bank for use with a computer based digital audio workstation (DAW). It provides several sliders or faders which can be used to control various parameters in a DAW such as volume level, effect amplitude, speed, sound envelope, etc.

It will use capacitive touch sensors for the user to adjust the fader value, and LED arrays to display the current value.
